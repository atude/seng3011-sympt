      "main_text": "A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said today [Thu 19 Mar 2020] that a pet dog sent to the AFCD has repeatedly tested positive for the COVID-19 virus. This is another infected case following an earlier case in which a 17-year-old Pomeranian dog tested weak positive during repeated tests for the virus.[see comment]. The current case involves a German Shepherd dog that lived in a residence at Pok Fu Lam. When the owner was confirmed with COVID-19, the dog was sent for quarantine with another mixed breed dog from the same residence to the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge yesterday (18 Mar 2020). No positive results were obtained from the mixed breed dog and neither dog has shown any signs of disease. The Department will continue to closely monitor both dogs and conduct repeated tests on the animals. The AFCD will continue to work together with the Department of Health in handling relevant cases. To ensure public and animal health, the Department strongly advises that mammalian pet animals including dogs and cats from households with persons confirmed as infected with COVID-19, or close contacts of COVID-19 infected persons, should be put under quarantine in AFCD facilities. The spokesman reminded pet owners to adopt good hygiene practices (including handwashing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing them) and to maintain a clean and hygienic household environment. People who are sick should restrict contact with animals. If there are any changes in the health condition of the pets, advice from a veterinarian should be sought as soon as possible. The spokesman emphasised that there is currently no evidence that pet animals can be a source of COVID-19 for humans or that this virus can cause the disease in dogs. Pet owners should always maintain good hygiene practices and under no circumstances should they abandon their pets. [This is the 2nd case of a domestic dog in Hong Kong, owned by a COVID-19 patient, undergoing tests for the pandemic's virus. A blood sample was also taken from the dog on [3 Mar 2020] for serological testing and the result is negative. The negative result indicates that there is not a strong immune response and that there are no measurable amounts of antibodies in the blood at this stage. \"The negative serological test result does not suggest that the dog has not been infected with the virus. It is known in some asymptomatic or mild cases of human infections with other types of coronavirus that antibodies may not always develop. It is also not uncommon in the earlier stages of infections to have a negative result as it often takes 14 days or more for measurable levels of antibodies to be detected. Another blood sample will be taken later for further testing\". \"On the other hand, the Department, together with the School of Public Health of the University of Hong Kong, has conducted gene sequencing of the COVID-19 virus found from the dog and its close contact persons who were confirmed infected. The viral sequences are very similar. The sequence results indicate that the virus likely spread from the infected persons and subsequently infected the dog. \"The dog has not shown any signs of the disease related to COVID-19. It is currently under quarantine at the animal keeping facility at the Hong Kong Port of Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao Bridge. The Department will continue to closely monitor the dog which tested weakly positive for the COVID-19 virus and repeat the test later. It will only be returned to its owner when the test result is negative. The Department has stepped up cleansing and disinfection of the facility.\" Unfortunately, the said elderly Pomeranian died on Mon [16 Mar 2020], 2 days after it was released (Sat 14 Mar 2020) from quarantine following the recovery of its owner and \"after further tests produced negative results\". According to AFCA's report, the cause of death couldn't be determined since the owner declined to conduct an autopsy (media report at. Hence, serological and clinical follow-up has become impossible. Though the cause of death is unknown, it may be assumed that it is related to the very old age of the animal and not necessarily to the dog's COVID-19 history.  The age, gender and detailed timeline of the current, 2nd case (German shepherd) will help in assessing the significance of the PCR results and of the information obtained in relation to the 1st case. Such information is of relevance to households with pets, to their medics and their vets in all COVID-19-affected countries. - Mod.AS]The current spread of COVID-19 is a result of human to human transmission. To date, there is no evidence that companion animals can spread the disease. Therefore, there is no justification in taking measures against companion animals which may compromise their welfare. The test, conducted by real time PCR, showed the presence of genetic material from the COVID-19 virus. The dog was not showing any clinical signs of the disease. There is no evidence that dogs play a role in the spread of this human disease or that they become sick. Further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19 virus. The OIE will continue to provide updates as new information becomes available. There is no evidence to support restrictions to movement or trade of companion animals. 2. What precautionary measures should be taken by owners when companion or other animals have close contact with humans sick or suspected with COVID-19? There have not been any reports of companion or other animals becoming sick with COVID-19 and currently there is no evidence that they play a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus. When handling and caring for animals, basic hygiene measures should always be implemented. This includes hand washing before and after being around or handling animals, their food, or supplies, as well as avoiding kissing, licking or sharing food. When possible, people who are sick or under medical attention for COVID-19 should avoid close contact with their pets and have another member of their household care for their animals. If they must look after their pet, they should maintain good hygiene practices and wear a face mask if possible. 3. What can National Veterinary Services do with regards to companion animals? Public Health and Veterinary Services should work together using a One Health approach to share information and conduct a risk assessment when a person with COVID-19 reports being in contact with companion or other animals. If a decision is made as a result of a risk assessment to test a companion animal which has had close contact with a person/owner infected with COVID-19, it is recommended that RT-PCR be used to test oral, nasal and fecal/rectal samples. While there is no evidence of a COVID-19 infection spreading from one animal to another, keeping animals that test positive for COVID-19 away from unexposed animals should be considered best practice. 4. What are the Veterinary Authority's international responsibilities in this event? The detection of COVID-19 virus in animals meets the criteria for reporting to the OIE through WAHIS, in accordance with the OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code as an emerging disease. Therefore, any detection of the COVID-19 virus in an animal (including information about the species, diagnostic tests, and relevant epidemiological information) should be reported to the OIE. It is important for Veterinary Authorities to remain informed and maintain close liaison with public health authorities and those responsible for wildlife, to ensure coherent and appropriate risk communication messages and risk management. It is important that COVID-19 does not lead to inappropriate measures being taken against domestic or wild animals which might compromise their welfare and health or have a negative impact on biodiversity. [Hong Kong's One Health-based system is highly commendable, contributing to essential epidemiological data, which pertain to man and animal, becoming available for all. According to the Thematic Household Survey Report No. 66 of HK's Census and Statistics Department, a total of around 221 100 dogs and 184 100 cats were being kept by households in Hong Kong in 2018. The numbers of registered veterinary surgeons, during the years 2015 - 2019, were, respectively, 823, 861, 920, 988 and (during 2019), 1049. The veterinarian-to-pet (dog and cat) ratio (2018 data) was around 1:410 (official information;. The following excerpt from article 2 above is of particular significance: \"currently there is no evidence that (in-contact companion animals) play a significant epidemiological role in this human disease. However, because animals and people can sometimes share diseases (known as zoonotic diseases), it is still recommended that people who are sick with COVID-19 limit contact with companion and other animals until more information is known about the virus\". Hopefully, additional similar observations will allow considering the epidemiological role of companion animals (dogs AND cats) in human COVID-19 as negligible; at present, it cannot be viewed as such. Additional gathered experience, including PCR and serologic test results of in-contact company animals in HK and elsewhere, is warranted. - Mod.AS",

There are now a total of 138 044 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 160 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 20 425 cases when compared with the data on 17 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 4207 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1192 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 152 of the newly reported cases. Spain (2943), Germany (2960), France (1404), and the USA (2792) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 63.0% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. A global total of 8968 deaths have been reported, 5723 outside mainland China. For the 21th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of Mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by Mainland China. Unfortunately South Korea's descending trend reversed and there's been an increase in confirmed cases. - Mod.MPP]At 04:00 on [18 Mar 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 34 new confirmed cases, 8 new deaths (8 in Hubei), and 23 new suspected cases. On the same day, 819 new cases were cured and discharged, 1032 close contacts were released from medical observation, and 308 severe cases were reduced. As of 24:00 on [18 Mar 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 7263 confirmed cases (among which, 2314 were severe cases), 70 420 cases were cured and 3245 cases were dead. A total of 80 928 confirmed cases have been reported, and 105 suspected cases have been reported. A total of 683 281 close contacts were traced, and 9144 were close contacts still in medical observation. There were 0 newly confirmed cases in Hubei (0 in Wuhan), 795 newly cured cases (733 in Wuhan), 8 new deaths (6 in Wuhan), and 6792 confirmed cases (6,674 in Wuhan). Among them, there were 2274 severe cases (2222 in Wuhan). A total of 57 678 discharged patients (40 765 in Wuhan) were cured, 3130 deaths (2496 in Wuhan), and 67 800 confirmed cases (in Wuhan, 5005). There were 0 new suspected cases (0 in Wuhan) and 0 existing suspected cases (0 in Wuhan). At 04:00 on [18 Mar 2020], 34 newly diagnosed imported cases were reported (21 in Beijing, 9 in Guangdong, 2 in Shanghai, 1 in Heilongjiang, and 1 in Zhejiang). As of 24:00 on [18 Mar 2020], a total of 189 overseas confirmed cases were reported. A total of 307 confirmed cases were reported from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan: 192 cases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (95 cases discharged, 4 deaths), 15 cases in Macau Special Administrative Region (10 cases discharged), 100 cases in Taiwan (22 cases discharged, 1 case died). [The big news, this is the 1st time since the epidemic was identified that there are no newly confirmed, locally acquired cases in China in the past 24 hours. While one day isn't a definitive interruption of transmission it certainly is very promising. A media (or perhaps social media) report mentioned that many overseas students from China are now returning to their homes feeling safer in China than in the countries where they are studying. The challenge will be to identify all infections before they can escape from detection and start spreading in the community. According to the report above, a total of 80 928 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 34 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (17 Mar 2020) report was prepared. In addition, 8 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. 24 new cases were reported from Hong Kong, which bears watching as the cases have been slowly climbing. After more than 2.5 months of no newly confirmed cases, Macau has been confirming 1 new case a day for the past 3 days, and 4 new cases in the past 24 hours. All 34 newly confirmed cases were imported cases into China representing 100% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Cases were reported by Guangdong (9), Beijing (21), Shanghai (2), Heilongjiang (1) and Zhejiang (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 189.

Data source: Korean CDC [in Korean] Distribution of cases by metropolitan city/province: total case / change from 0:00 AM 18 Mar 2020 to 0:00 AM 19 Mar 2020: [Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 152 cases and 7 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (17-18 Mar 2020) when there were 93 newly confirmed cases. This is both worrisome as well as disappointing, as for 2 days it appeared as though the transmission was actually slowing down. Once again Daegu stands out as a focal point for transmission with 97 newly confirmed cases reported and Gyeonggi with 18 newly confirmed cases and Gyeonbuk with 12 newly confirmed cases. We await the release of information form an epidemiologic investigation of this increase in reported cases.

At the moment 28 710 people are positive for the virus. 4025 people have recovered. There are 14 363 hospitalized patients with symptoms, 2257 in intensive care, and 12 090 are in home isolation. There have been 2978 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death. [The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 35 713 cases, including 2978 deaths, up from 31 506 cases and 2503 deaths reported on 17 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 17 and 18 Mar 2020 was 4207 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3233 newly confirmed cases between 16 and 17 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (17 713), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (4525), and Venice (3214), all in the northern part of the country, but there are signs the case loads may be increasing outside of these 3 northern provinces. Yesterday [17 Mar 2020], these 3 provinces accounted for 62.7% of newly confirmed cases in the preceding 24 hours, down from 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours. Today (18 Mar 2020) the proportion of newly confirmed cases in these 3 provinces has decreased further to 54.3% of the total newly confirmed cases. It is beginning to look like a trend. The growth in cases in the northern provinces continues, but apparently the growth in other provinces is continuing at a more rapid pace. There is an excellent interactive map atto visualize the caseloads per region in near real time. On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus. A map of Italy showing regions can be seen atand a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at. - Mod.MPP]Iran's death toll from the new COVID-19 coronavirus has surpassed 1000 people, as health officials confirmed on state television that the government had recorded hundreds of new cases. \"Now everyone knows about this disease, and what is very strange is that some don't take it seriously,\" Deputy Health Minister Alireza Raisi said in a televised news conference. \"If people help, we can control it, and if not, then expect it to last more than 2 months.\" Tehran province had the highest number of new cases with 213. Isfahan in central Iran was second with 162, followed by East Azerbaijan in the northwest with 84. Raisi called on people to be patient, after complaining that bazaars in the capital Tehran are busy and people have been travelling in their cars despite government warnings against it. \"Just be patient for these 2 weeks so that, God willing, we can overcome this virus,\" Raisi said. Coronavirus is especially dangerous for the elderly, and people with preexisting medical conditions, such diabetes, lung, and heart diseases. In the central city of Semnan, a 103-year-old woman has recovered from the virus, state media reported late on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020]. The unnamed woman had been hospitalised for about a week, but was \"discharged after making a complete recovery\", Semnan University of Medical Sciences head Navid Danayi was quoted as saying by IRNA [Islamic Republic News Agency]. The woman was the 2nd elderly patient in Iran to have survived the disease. On Monday [16 Mar 2020], a 91-year-old man from Kerman city, who already suffers from high blood pressure and asthma, recovered from coronavirus after being sick for 3 days. IRNA's report did not say how the pair were treated. [In the 24 hours from 17 to 18 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 16 169 to 17 151 an increase of 982 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 988 to 1135, an increase of 147 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran. A map of Iran showing provinces can be seen atand a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at. - Mod.MPP] [In the past 24 hours 8 countries/territories have confirmed 1st cases of COVID-19 in their countries/territories: 3 are in the Americas region (El Salvador, Nicaragua, Bermuda), 2 are in the African region (Zambia, Mauritius), 2 are in the Western Pacific region (New Caledonia, Fiji), and 1 is in the Eastern Mediterranean region (Djibouti). Importations involve the USA, Panama, Italy, France, Spain, UK, cruise ship crew, and Australia. - Mod.MPP[All tables, figures, and references can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP] Early data from China suggest that a majority of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) deaths have occurred among adults aged 60 years or older and among persons with serious underlying health conditions. This 1st preliminary description of outcomes among patients with COVID-19 in the United States indicates that fatality was highest in persons aged 85 years or older, ranging from 10% to 27%, followed by 3% to 11% among persons aged 65-84 years, 1% to 3% among persons aged 55-64 years, less than 1% among persons aged 20-54 years, and no fatalities among persons aged 19 years or younger. COVID-19 can result in severe disease, including hospitalization, admission to an intensive care unit, and death, especially among older adults. Everyone can take actions, such as social distancing, to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults from severe illness. Globally, approximately 170 000 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) have been reported, including an estimated 7000 deaths in approximately 150 countries (1). On [11 Mar 2020], the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic (2). Data from China have indicated that older adults, particularly those with serious underlying health conditions, are at higher risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness and death than are younger persons (3). Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases in China were mild (81%), approximately 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged 60 years or older; only one (0.1%) death occurred in a person 19 years or younger (3). In this report, COVID-19 cases in the United States that occurred during [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020] and severity of disease (hospitalization, admission to intensive care unit [ICU], and death) were analyzed by age group. As of [16 Mar 2020] , a total of 4226 COVID-19 cases in the United States had been reported to CDC, with multiple cases reported among older adults living in long-term care facilities (4). Overall, 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 were among adults aged 65 years or older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged 85 years or older. In contrast, no ICU admissions or deaths were reported among persons aged 19 years or younger. Similar to reports from other countries, this finding suggests that the risk for serious disease and death from COVID-19 is higher in older age groups. Data from cases reported from 49 states, the District of Columbia, and 3 US territories (5) to CDC during [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020] were analyzed. Cases among persons repatriated to the United States from Wuhan, China and from Japan (including patients repatriated from cruise ships) were excluded. States and jurisdictions voluntarily reported data on laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 using previously developed data collection forms (6). The cases described in this report include both COVID-19 cases confirmed by state or local public health laboratories as well as those with a positive test at the state or local public health laboratories and confirmation at CDC. No data on serious underlying health conditions were available. Data on these cases are preliminary and are missing for some key characteristics of interest, including hospitalization status (1514), ICU admission (2253), death (2001), and age (386). Because of these missing data, the percentages of hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and deaths (case-fatality percentages) were estimated as a range. The lower bound of these percentages was estimated by using all cases within each age group as denominators. The corresponding upper bound of these percentages was estimated by using only cases with known information on each outcome as denominators. As of [16 Mar 2020], a total of 4226 COVID-19 cases had been reported in the United States, with reports increasing to 500 or more cases per day beginning [14 Mar 2020 (Figure 1. Number of new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases reported daily, (N = 4226) -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]). Among 2449 patients with known age, 6% were aged 85 years or older, 25% were aged 65-84 years, 18% each were aged 55-64 years and 45-54 years, and 29% were aged 20-44 years (Figure 2. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and deaths, by age group -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]). Only 5% of cases occurred in persons aged 0-19 years. Among 508 (12%) patients known to have been hospitalized, 9% were aged 85 years or older, 26% were aged 65-84 years, 17% were aged 55-64 years, 18% were 45-54 years, and 20% were aged 20-44 years. Less than 1% of hospitalizations were among persons aged 19 years or younger (Figure 2). The percentage of persons hospitalized increased with age, from 2%-3% among persons aged 9 years or younger, to 31% or higher among adults aged 85 years or older. (Table Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and case-fatality percentages for reported COVID-19 cases, by age group -- United States, [12 Feb 2020-16 Mar 2020]). Among 121 patients known to have been admitted to an ICU, 7% of cases were reported among adults 85 years or older, 46% among adults aged 65-84 years, 36% among adults aged 45-64 years, and 12% among adults aged 20-44 years (Figure 2). No ICU admissions were reported among persons aged 19 years or younger. Percentages of ICU admissions were lowest among adults aged 20-44 years (2%-4%) and highest among adults aged 75-84 years (11%-31%) (Table). Among 44 cases with known outcomes, 15 (34%) deaths were reported among adults aged 85 years or older, 20 (46%) among adults aged 65-84 years, and 9 (20%) among adults aged 20-64 years. Case-fatality percentages increased with increasing age, from no deaths reported among persons 19 years or younger to the highest percentages (10%-27%) among adults aged 85 years or older (Table) (Figure 2). Since [12 Feb2020], 4226 COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States; 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions, and 80% of deaths occurred among adults aged 65 years or older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among persons aged 85 years or older. These findings are similar to data from China, which indicated greater than 80% of deaths occurred among persons aged 60 years or older (3). These preliminary data also demonstrate that severe illness leading to hospitalization, including ICU admission and death, can occur in adults of any age with COVID-19. In contrast, persons aged 19 years or younger appear to have milder COVID-19 illness, with almost no hospitalizations or deaths reported to date in the United States in this age group. Given the spread of COVID-19 in many US communities, CDC continues to update current recommendations and develop new resources and guidance, including for adults aged 65 years or older as well as those involved in their care (7,8). Approximately 49 million US persons are aged 65 years or older (9), and many of these adults, who are at risk for severe COVID-19-associated illness, might depend on services and support to maintain their health and independence. To prepare for potential COVID-19 illness among persons at high risk, family members, and caregivers of older adults should know what medications they are taking and ensure that food and required medical supplies are available. Long-term care facilities should be particularly vigilant to prevent the introduction and spread of COVID-19 (10). In addition, clinicians who care for adults should be aware that COVID-19 can result in severe disease among persons of all ages. Persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms and call their provider for guidance if symptoms worsen or seek emergency care for persistent severe symptoms. Additional guidance is available for health care providers on CDC's website. This report describes the current epidemiology of COVID-19 in the United States, using preliminary data. The findings in this report are subject to at least 5 limitations. First, data were missing for key variables of interest. Data on age and outcomes, including hospitalization, ICU admission, and death, were missing for 9%-53% of cases, which likely resulted in an underestimation of these outcomes. Second, further time for follow-up is needed to ascertain outcomes among active cases. Third,, the initial approach to testing was to identify patients among those with travel histories or persons with more severe disease, and these data might overestimate the prevalence of severe disease. Fourth, data on other risk factors, including serious underlying health conditions that could increase risk for complications and severe illness, were unavailable at the time of this analysis. Finally, limited testing to date underscores the importance of ongoing surveillance of COVID-19 cases. Additional investigation will increase the understanding about persons who are at risk for severe illness and death from COVID-19 and inform clinical guidance and community-based mitigation measures. The risk for serious disease and death in COVID-19 cases among persons in the United States increases with age. Social distancing is recommended for all ages to slow the spread of the virus, protect the health care system, and help protect vulnerable older adults. Further, older adults should maintain adequate supplies of nonperishable foods and at least a 30-day supply of necessary medications, take precautions to keep space between themselves and others, stay away from those who are sick, avoid crowds as much as possible, avoid cruise travel and nonessential air travel, and stay home as much as possible to further reduce the risk of being exposed (7). Persons of all ages and communities can take actions to help slow the spread of COVID-19 and protect older adults. [This report is adding to the increasing number of reports identifying advanced age as a risk factor for serious disease. The USA experience (early on in the outbreak). The mention of limitations merits heeding. Until there is a better handle on the real infection rate, which will only happen once we have adequate serology to see what the true subclinical infection rate is, we continue to most likely see the tip of the iceberg of the most severe and ultimately fatal cases. - Mod.MPP HealthMap/ProMED-mail map of the United States:[All tables, figures and references can be found at the source URL above. - Mod.MPP] Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can cause severe illness and death, particularly among older adults with chronic health conditions. Introduction of COVID-19 into a long-term residential care facility in Washington resulted in cases among 81 residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members, restricting visitation except in compassionate care situations, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures. On [28 Feb 2020], a case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was identified in a woman resident of a long-term care skilled nursing facility (facility A) in King County, Washington. Epidemiologic investigation of facility A identified 129 cases of COVID-19 associated with facility A, including 81 of the residents, 34 staff members, and 14 visitors; 23 persons died. Limitations in effective infection control and prevention and staff members working in multiple facilities contributed to intra- and interfacility spread. COVID-19 can spread rapidly in long-term residential care facilities, and persons with chronic underlying medical conditions are at greater risk for COVID-19-associated severe disease and death. Long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to protect the health of residents and preserve the health care workforce by identifying and excluding potentially infected staff members and visitors, ensuring early recognition of potentially infected patients, and implementing appropriate infection control measures. On [27 Feb 2020], Public Health - Seattle and King County (PHSKC) was notified by a local health care provider of a patient whose symptom history and clinical presentation met the revised testing criteria for COVID-19, which included testing of persons with severe respiratory illness of unknown etiology (1). The patient was a woman aged 73 years with a history of coronary artery disease, insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, obesity, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, who resided in facility A along with approximately 130 residents who were cared for by 170 health care personnel. Beginning in mid-February [2020], the facility had experienced a cluster of febrile respiratory illnesses. Rapid influenza test results were obtained from several residents; all were negative. The patient had cough, fever, and shortness of breath requiring oxygen for 5 days at facility A. She reported no travel or known contact with anyone with COVID-19. On [24 Feb 2020], she was transported to a local hospital because of worsening respiratory symptoms and hypoxemia. Upon hospital admission, the patient was febrile to 103.3 deg F (39.6 deg C), tachycardic, and was found to have hypoxemic respiratory failure. On [25 Feb 2020], she required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Computed tomography scan showed diffuse bilateral infiltrates; however, multiplex viral respiratory panel and bacterial cultures of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were negative. 4 days after hospital admission, nasopharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs and sputum specimens were collected to test for SARS-CoV-2; results were reported positive for all specimens on [28 Feb 2020]. The patient died on [2 Mar 2020]. Following notification of the index case of COVID-19, PHSKC, and CDC immediately began investigating the cluster of respiratory illness in facility A to collect information on symptoms, severity, comorbidities, travel history, and close contacts to known COVID-19 cases by interviewing patients or a proxy for cases in which the patient could not be interviewed. Diagnostic testing by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (2-5) was performed for patients and staff members meeting clinical case criteria for COVID-19 (1). As of [9 Mar 2020], a total of 129 COVID-19 cases were confirmed among facility residents (81 of approximately 130), staff members, including health care personnel (34), and visitors (14). Health care personnel with confirmed COVID-19 included the following occupations: physical therapist, occupational therapist assistant, environmental care worker, nurse, certified nursing assistant, health information officer, physician, and case manager. Overall, 111 (86%) cases occurred among residents of King County (81 facility A residents, 17 staff members, and 13 visitors) and 18 (14%) among residents of Snohomish County (directly north of King County) (17 staff members and one visitor). Reported symptom onset dates for facility residents and staff members ranged from [16 Feb 2020] to [5 Mar 2020]. The median patient age was 81 years (range = 54-100 years) among facility residents, 42.5 years (range = 22-79 years) among staff members, and 62.5 years (range = 52-88 years) among visitors; 84 (65.1%) patients were women (Table Characteristics of patients with COVID-19 epidemiologically linked to facility A among residents of King and Snohomish counties -- Washington, February 27-March 9, 2020). Overall, 56.8% of facility A residents, 35.7% of visitors, and 5.9% of staff members with COVID-19 were hospitalized. Preliminary case fatality rates among residents and visitors as of [9 Mar 2020] were 27.2% and 7.1%, respectively; no deaths occurred among staff members. The most common chronic underlying conditions among facility residents were hypertension (69.1%), cardiac disease (56.8%), renal disease (43.2%), diabetes (37.0%), obesity (33.3%), and pulmonary disease (32.1%). Six residents and one visitor had hypertension as their only chronic underlying condition. As part of the response effort, approximately 100 long-term care facilities in King County were contacted through an emailed survey using REDCap (6), and information was requested about residents or staff members known to have COVID-19 or clusters of respiratory illness among residents and staff members. In addition, countywide databases of emergency medical service transfers from long-term care facilities to acute care facilities were reviewed daily for evidence of cases or clusters of serious respiratory illness. Routine active surveillance reports to PHSKC for influenza-like illness clusters from long-term care facilities were employed to identify clusters of illness consistent with COVID-19. All long-term care facilities with evidence of a cluster of respiratory illness were contacted by telephone for additional information, including infection control strategies in place and availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Based on this information, the long-term care facilities were prioritized by risk for COVID-19 introduction and spread, and highest priority facilities were visited by response personnel for provision of emergency on-site testing and infection control assessment, support, and training. As of [9 Mar 2020], at least 8 other King County skilled nursing and assisted living facilities had reported one or more confirmed COVID-19 cases. Information received from the survey and on-site visits identified factors that likely contributed to the vulnerability of these facilities, including 1) staff members who worked while symptomatic; 2) staff members who worked in more than one facility; 3) inadequate familiarity and adherence to standard, droplet, and contact precautions and eye protection recommendations; 4) challenges to implementing infection control practices including inadequate supplies of PPE and other items (e.g., alcohol-based hand sanitizer) §; 5) delayed recognition of cases because of low index of suspicion, limited testing availability, and difficulty identifying persons with COVID-19 based on signs and symptoms alone. These findings demonstrate that outbreaks of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities can have a critical impact on vulnerable older adults. In Washington, local and state authorities implemented comprehensive prevention measures for long-term care facilities (7-9) that included 1) implementation of symptom screening and restriction policies for visitors and nonessential personnel; 2) active screening of health care personnel, including measurement and documentation of body temperature and ascertainment of respiratory symptoms to identify and exclude symptomatic workers; 3) symptom monitoring of residents; 4) social distancing, including restricting resident movement and group activities; 5) staff training on infection control and PPE use; and 6) establishment of plans to address local PPE shortages, including county and state coordination of supply chains and stockpile releases to meet needs. These strategies require coordination and support from public health authorities, partnering health care systems, regulatory agencies, and their respective governing bodies (8-10). The findings in this report suggest that once COVID-19 has been introduced into a long-term care facility, it has the potential to result in high attack rates among residents, staff members, and visitors. In the context of rapidly escalating COVID-19 outbreaks in much of the United States, it is critical that long-term care facilities implement active measures to prevent introduction of COVID-19. Measures to consider include identifying and excluding symptomatic staff members, restricting visitation except in compassionate care situations, and strengthening infection prevention and control guidance and adherence (7,9,10). Substantial morbidity and mortality might be averted if all long-term care facilities take steps now to prevent exposure of their residents to COVID-19. The underlying health conditions and advanced age of many long-term care facility residents and the shared location of patients in one facility places these persons at risk for severe morbidity and death. Rapid and sustained public health interventions focusing on surveillance, infection control, and mitigation efforts are resource-intensive but are critical to curtailing COVID-19 transmission and decreasing the impact on vulnerable populations, such as residents of long-term care facilities, and the community at large. As this pandemic expands, continued implementation of public health measures targeting vulnerable populations such as residents of long-term care facilities (8) and health care personnel will be critical. As public health measures are continually implemented, public information needs will only grow. To provide information for patients and families as well as communicate more broadly to all stakeholders, public officials and other community leaders need to work together to encourage everyone to understand and adhere to recommended guidelines to manage this outbreak. [A recipe for tragic consequences, given the observed increased risk of severe outcomes in individuals over age 60, and even more so over age 80. Introducing the SARS-CoV-2 into this population when there is an entire population that is naïve to this virus, will result in a serious outbreak with increased levels of morbidity and mortality. - Mod.MPP]The Berlin government said on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] it would create a new hospital to cope with a likely huge increase in coronavirus cases. The facility, which will house up to 1000 patients, will be set up in the Berlin Messe trade fair exhibition grounds in the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district of the German capital. The hospital will be built with the help of the German armed forces, the Bundeswehr. No further details on the exact location or the deadline for completion were given. The project was approved by the Senate, the executive body for the city and state of Berlin, who said the facility should only be used if other medical facilities are overrun. The new hospital is expected to treat both relatively minor coronavirus cases as well as emergency respiratory patients. \"This measure complements the well-positioned Berlin hospital system to deal with possible bottlenecks,\" said Berlin Health Senator Dilek Kalayci following the approval. She added that other hospitals in Berlin would expand their services to treat those coronavirus patients requiring ventilation in intensive care. Kalayci added that hospitals in the city would now begin postponing other scheduled surgeries to prepare to treat more patients struck down with COVID-19. On Tuesday [17 Mar 2020], Berlin already counted 332 coronavirus cases out of more than 7500 infections across Germany. The country has seen a rise of 1500 cases since Monday [16 Mar 2020]. 20 people have died so far. The German Hospital Federation (DKG) says around 500 people in the country are currently undergoing hospital treatment for SARS-CoV-2. Officials expect a much higher volume of people to require hospitalization in the next few months. Germany has announced strict measures to try to contain the pandemic and ensure the country's health sector can cope. Schools have been shut across most of the country, border controls have been tightened, and new restrictions put on public and social spaces. Companies are being urged to offer employees remote work. [China built 2 hospitals in one week's-time to address the surge need of hospital beds. Berlin is being proactive. It is not alone as a city trying to meet the increase need for services. - Mod.MPPNigeria is restricting entry into the country for travelers from 13 countries including the US and UK, as it announced 5 new cases Wednesday [18 Mar 2020]. The restriction will apply to travelers from countries with more than 1000 cases. They include China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Japan, France, Germany, the United States, Norway, UK, Netherlands, and Switzerland, the country's National Centre for Disease Control [NCDC] said on its Twitter account. \"The Federal Government of Nigeria has also suspended the issuance of visa on arrival to travelers from these countries. All travelers returning from these countries prior to the restriction will be in supervised self-isolation, monitored by the NCDC and Port Health Services,\" -- the tweet read. The restriction will take effect starting on [20 Mar 2020] and will be in place until further notice. Health officials also announced an additional 5 cases of the virus in the country, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 8. One of them is a recovered patient who came in contact with the index case to Nigeria, an Italian man on a business trip to the country, authorities said. [A glimpse of how a country in Africa is dealing with the impending impact of coronavirus in their country. Nigeria has an excellent public health infrastructure, but theoretically so do many of the European countries, the USA, and Canada, all areas now facing serious surge capacity issues. - Mod.MPP]*The situation report includes information provided by national authorities as of 00:00 CET - One new country/territory/area (European Region [1]) has reported cases of COVID-19. - Data presented in the COVID-19 Situation Reports has changed to reflect data reported as of 00:00 CET. As this is the 1st situation report with the new reporting period, there is overlap of data between Situation Report 57 and this report, thus the number of new cases may not equal the difference between total cases in the two reports. - WHO COVID-19 Situation Reports present official counts of confirmed COVID19 cases, thus differences between WHO reports and other sources of COVID19 data using different inclusion criteria and different data cutoff times are to be expected. - WHO, IFRC, and UNICEF jointly released the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 on [16 Mar 2020]. For more information, please see the 'subject in focus' section below. WHO, the International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) and UNICEF jointly released the Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 on [16 Mar 2020]-action-plan-guidance ). The RCCE guidance is a tool to support national health authorities, responders and other partners to develop, implement and monitor action plans for communicating effectively with the public and engaging with communities, local partners and other stakeholders. The tool includes a 7-step guidance process, which includes: collecting data and making assessments; developing coordination mechanisms; defining and prioritizing key objectives; identifying target audiences and key influencers; developing a RCCE strategy that fits into the country's response strategy; implementing the plan with partners and engaging the community; and developing a monitoring plan for evaluation purposes. The RCCE Action Plan Guidance has a planning template and practical annexes to assist with the exercise. - Ensure that all people at-risk of acquiring COVID-19 are identified, reached and involved. Risk Communication and Community Engagement is an essential component of health emergency preparedness and response. This Action Plan Guidance for COVID-19 provides a strategy and tool that helps to prepare and protect individuals, families and the public's health during early response to COVID-19. [As mentioned in the highlights above, WHO has now shifted from a 0:00 to 23:59 period for the preceding day in presenting data on confirmed cases reported to WHO. As this change just occurred, one sees variances in reported cases in the table that appear as though countries updates weren't entered. This should resolve moving forward. - Mod.MPP] These data come from Table 1: Countries, territories or with reported laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths.

There are now a total of 117 619 confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported from 165 countries/locations outside mainland China representing an increase of 15 895 cases when compared with the data on 16 Mar 2020, with Italy accounting for 3526 of the newly reported cases, Iran for 1178 of newly reported cases, and South Korea for 93 of the newly reported cases. Spain (1884), Germany (2095), France (1097), and the USA (1801) are major contributors to this increase as well. The total number of confirmed cases reported from outside of China now represents 59.3% of the total number of reported cases. The epicenter has shifted outside of China to Western Europe. A global total of 7988 deaths have been reported, 4751 outside mainland China. For the 20th consecutive day, more cases have been reported from outside mainland China than within mainland China. The total number of deaths reported from outside of Mainland China is now greater than the total number of deaths reported by Mainland China. And for the 4th day, the number of newly confirmed cases from South Korea was less than 100. - Mod.MPP]At 04:00 on [17 Mar 2020], 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps reported 13 new confirmed cases, 11 new deaths (11 in Hubei), and 21 new suspected cases. On the same day, 922 new cases were cured and discharged, and 1014 close contacts were released from medical observation, and 208 severe cases were reduced. As of 24:00 on [17 Mar 2020], according to reports from 31 provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there were 8056 confirmed cases (including 2622 severe cases), 69 601 cured cases and 3237 dead cases. A total of 80 894 confirmed cases were reported, with 119 suspected cases now. A total of 682 327 close contacts were traced, and 9222 close contacts were still in medical observation. 1 newly confirmed case in Hubei (1 in Wuhan), 896 newly cured cases (812 in Wuhan), 11 new deaths (10 in Wuhan), 7995 confirmed cases (7483 in Wuhan), Among them, 2580 were severe cases (2514 in Wuhan). A total of 56 883 discharged patients were cured (40 032 in Wuhan), 3122 deaths (2490 in Wuhan), and 67 800 confirmed cases (in Wuhan, 5005). There were 0 new suspected cases (0 in Wuhan), and 0 existing suspected cases (0 in Wuhan). At 04:00 on [17 Mar 2020], 12 newly diagnosed imported cases were reported (5 in Guangdong, 3 in Beijing, 3 in Shanghai, and 1 in Sichuan). As of 24:00 on [17 Mar 2020], a total of 155 overseas confirmed cases were reported. A total of 257 confirmed cases were reported from Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan: 167 cases in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (92 cases discharged, 4 deaths), 13 cases in Macau Special Administrative Region (10 cases discharged), 77 cases in Taiwan (22 cases discharged, 1 case died). [According to the report above, a total of 80 894 cases of confirmed COVID-19 have now been reported from mainland China, representing an increase of 13 cases in the past 24 hours since yesterday's (16 Mar 2020) report was prepared. It is now the 9th consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country. In addition, 11 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. 10 new cases were reported from Hong Kong. After more than 2.5 months of no newly confirmed cases, Macau has been confirming 1 new case a day for the past 3 days. There were 12 imported cases into China confirmed, representing 92.3% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours. Hence, all but one of the newly confirmed cases were imported cases. Cases were reported by Guangdong (5), Beijing (3), Shanghai (3), and Sichuan (1), bringing the total number of imported cases to 155. As I keep mentioning, a challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China. The 1 remaining case with local transmission, was from Wuhan in Hubei province. Interpretation: Wuhan is the location within China where the SARS-CoV-2 is still being transmitted. Albeit it appears to be approaching interruption of transmission. I remain interested in seeing a table of locations of origin of imported cases. A map of China showing provinces can be seen atand a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map is available at. - Mod.MPP]Data taken from a table on the website of the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW). Data source: Korean CDC [in Korean] In the 18 Mar 2020 Mar 2020 English language webpage: population rates per 100 000 by province were added. - Epidemiological links have been found for 80.6% of the total cases; 19.4% are either under investigation or sporadic cases. More details on the epidemiological links within each province or city are shown in Table 1 [at the URL above] on the next page. Distribution of the cases by sex and age groups are as indicated in Table 2 [source URL]. A graph of imported cases by period and region of origin is provided in Figure 1 [source URL]. - 5 additional confirmed cases have been reported from the call center located in Guro-gu, Seoul, amounting to a current total of 134 confirmed cases from the call center since [8 Mar 2020]. Investigations of the confirmed cases who are onset of symptom at the end of February [2020] revealed that they are not Shincheonji members, have no recent history of overseas travel, and have no known link to other confirmed cases. - A current total of 47 confirmed cases have been reported from a church (Grace River Church) in Gyeonggi Province since 9 March. Further investigation and contact tracing are underway. - The KCDC released the data it has collected on the characteristics of pediatric COVID-19 cases (patients aged 18 years old or younger). A total of 352 confirmed pediatric cases have been reported, among whom 56 have been discharged and 296 are currently in isolation. Discharge rate for pediatric patients is 15.9%, compared to 16.8% for all ages. There has been no fatalities. No severe cases occurred. Further detailed analysis of pediatric cases is underway. More data will be made available as soon as the analysis is completed. - In light of the recent rise in the number of confirmed cases from airport quarantine, the KCDC announced that the Special Entry Procedure will be extended to all travelers arriving at port beginning at 0:00 of [19 Mar 2020]. The Special Entry Procedure requires the traveler to be checked for fever, provide a confirmed contact information at port entry, and report their symptoms daily for the next 14 days via self-health check mobile app. Travel history of all travelers entering Korea will be provided to healthcare providers via the International Traveler Information System for reference. - Travelers who have visited Europe, the US, or Asia in the past 14 days are advised to minimize movement, adhere to social distancing personal hygiene measures, since infected persons with mild symptoms in initial stages of the disease may unknowingly transmit the virus to other people. - The KCDC will be having a conference meeting with WHO clinical team/COVID-19 advisors, representatives of relevant institutions, and domestic experts and researchers. This meeting, initiated by WHO who expressed interest in participating in the COVID-19 cohort research by domestic healthcare professionals, is expected to be helpful in developing future strategies for responding to the global pandemic. [Note that the reporting interval is now midnight to midnight, presenting the full calendar day. In the past 24 hours, the tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South Korea has increased by 84 cases and 3 deaths as compared with yesterday's 24 hour period (16-17 Mar 2020) when there were 84 newly confirmed cases. This is the 2nd consecutive day that the number of confirmed cases has increased. Looking at the number of cases per province, many of the provinces had an increase in number of newly confirmed cases. The epicenter of this outbreak is still Daegu province with 6144 reported cases and the surrounding province of Gyeongbuk with 1178 reported cases. Looking at the population based rates, Daegu 252.17 per 100 000 population and Gyeongbuk had a rate of 44.24 per 100 000 population, supporting the observation they are the epicenters of this outbreak in South Korea. There were 11 provinces not reporting any new cases in the previous update, but only 4 provinces not reporting any new cases in this current update. . Interestingly there are now 11 individuals in quarantine (up from 6 the day before), detected through airport screening, who have tested positive showing that imported cases may potentially lead to more chains of transmission if not identified early. A map of South Korea showing provinces can be seen atand a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at. - Mod.MPP]Regarding health monitoring related to the spread of the new coronavirus [SARS-CoV-2] on the national territory, there are 31 506 total cases. At the moment 26 062 people are positive for the virus. 2941 people have recovered. There are 12 894 patients hospitalized with symptoms, in intensive care 2060, and 11 108 are in home isolation. There have been 2503 reported deaths, however this number can be confirmed only after the Istituto Superiore di Sanita has established the actual cause of the death. [The tally of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Italy is now, 31 506 cases, including 2503 deaths, up from 27 980 cases and 2158 deaths reported on 16 Mar 2020. The 24-hour change between 16 and 17 Mar 2020 was 3526 newly confirmed cases, compared with 3233 newly confirmed cases between 15 and 16 Mar 2020. Cases continue to be concentrated in Lombardy (16 220), the epicenter of the outbreak, Emilia-Romagna (3931), and Venice (2704), all in the northern part of the country. These 3 provinces account for 62.7% of newly confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, down from 73.8% of newly confirmed cases in the prior 24 hours, a single drop but it may signal increasing cases outside of this region. There is an excellent interactive map atto visualize the caseloads per region in near real time. On 9 Mar 2020, Italy announced a lockdown for the northern provinces where the outbreak was concentrated. On 10 Mar 2020, this was changed to be countrywide. On 11 Mar 2020, Italy announced the closure of non-essential businesses. As for seeing an impact, one shouldn't expect to see an impact until at least one incubation period has passed, as there are newly infected individuals who are still in their incubation period for up to 14 days. That being said, there is no trend for stabilizing or decreasing the daily number of new cases that are confirmed. As mentioned before, the Public Health world is looking at Italy to see if this is feasible and if it has an impact in terms of slowing down transmission of the virus. A map of Italy showing regions can be seen atand a HealthMap/ProMED-mail map at. - Mod.MPP]Iran announced on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020] another 135 deaths from the novel coronavirus, bringing the overall toll to 988 in one of the world's worst-hit countries. \"Reports by more than 56 laboratories indicated that we have had 1178 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in the past 24 hours,\" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said in a televised news conference. \"This brings the total number of confirmed cases to 16 169 as of today noon [17 Mar 2020],\" he added. Jahanpour also said 5389 people who were infected had been discharged from hospitals \"with general good health.\" Tehran province recorded the highest number of new infections with 273 fresh cases. Alborz, to the west of Tehran, was next with 116, followed by East Azerbaijan with 78. \"As of this morning [17 Mar 2020], more than 15 million of our countrymen have been screened\" for symptoms, he said. The official reiterated calls for Iranians to stay at home during the outbreak and asked them to report possible symptoms on a ministry website. The website identifies the individual using their national identity number and asks if they have symptoms such as coughing or fever. It also asks if anyone suspected of having the virus, under treatment or recently recovered lives with them.

[In the 24 hours from 16 to 17 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 14 991 to 16 169 an increase of 1178 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 853 to 988, an increase of 115 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame. This seems to be a repetitive story, countries' health sectors being overwhelmed with the pandemic. Wuhan China began, followed by Italy, and now Iran.

Importations involve the USA, Saudi Arabia, UK; and 1 imported case with no details of the source of infection. - Mod.MPP An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among passengers and crew on a cruise ship led to quarantine of approximately 3700 passengers and crew that began on [3 Feb 2020], and lasted for nearly 4 weeks at the Port of Yokohama, Japan (1). By [9 Feb 2020] 20 cases had occurred among the ship's crew members. By the end of quarantine, approximately 700 cases of COVID-19 had been laboratory-confirmed among passengers and crew. This report describes findings from the initial phase of the cruise ship investigation into COVID-19 cases among crew members during [4-12 Feb 2020]. On [1 Feb 2020], a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 was identified in a passenger who had developed symptoms on [23 Jan 2020] and disembarked on [25 Jan 2020], before the ship arrived in Yokohama. Another passenger with a laboratory-confirmed case of COVID-19 had developed symptoms on [22 Jan 2020] and was on the ship when it arrived in Yokohama on [3 Feb 2020]. All symptomatic passengers were tested upon arrival in Yokohama, and those with positive results were disembarked [4 and 5 Feb 2020]. The index patient for this outbreak could not be determined. On [5 Feb 2020], passengers remaining on the ship were requested to observe 14-day quarantine in their cabins. Approximately 2 thirds of the persons on board were passengers staying in cabins located on decks 5-12. The remainder (N = 1068) were crew members, greater than 80% of whose cabins were on decks 2-4. Crew members remained on board the ship at all times and had not disembarked during port calls. After quarantine began, crew members continued to perform their regular duties, delivered meals to passengers, and remained in their cabins when they were not working; symptomatic crew members were required to remain in their cabins. Because the 1st detected cases occurred among passengers who became symptomatic on[ 22 and 23 Jan 2020], COVID-19 was likely transmitted 1st from passengers to crew members and subsequently spread among the crew, especially among food service workers. The 1st case detected in a crew member occurred in a food service worker who developed fever on [2 Feb 2020]. A real-time polymerase chain reaction test performed by the Yokohama quarantine office laboratory was positive for SARS-CoV-2, the etiologic agent of COVID-19, and the crew member was permitted to disembark in Yokohama on [4 Feb 2020]. By [9 Feb 2020], a total of 20 cases* among crew members had been laboratory-confirmed, including 3 in those who reported close contact with other crew members with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 before implementation of quarantine. Seven ill crew members had symptom onset within 3 days of the start of quarantine, indicating that some SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely occurred before the implementation of quarantine. The crew dining area was identified as the primary area of congregation for the crew; passengers did not have access to this part of the ship. The earliest laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in crew members occurred in food service workers; 15 of the 20 confirmed cases in crew members occurred among food service workers who prepared food for other crew members, and 16 of the 20 cases occurred among persons with cabins on deck 3, the deck on which the food service workers lived ([Table: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and fever status among crew members aboard a cruise ship (N = 1068) - Yokohama, Japan, February 2020; available at the source URL above]). Until [6 Feb 2020], no mechanism for systematic testing was implemented; only crew members who visited the medical clinic with symptoms were tested, and information on the total number of tests administered is not available. The cruise ship company administered a questionnaire to all crew members on [3 Feb 2020], at which time 3 crew members reported subjective fever. A 2nd survey of crew members was conducted on [9 Feb 2020] at which time fever was reported by 31 crew members, 20 (65%) of whom were food service workers. Interviews were conducted with 9 crew members with confirmed COVID-19 on [12 Feb 2020], just before their disembarkation; 3 of these patients reported close contact with other crew members with confirmed COVID-19 before their symptoms began. These interviews indicated that infection had apparently spread among persons whose cabins were on the same deck (deck 3) and who worked in the same occupational group (food service), probably through contact or droplet spread, which is consistent with current understanding of COVID-19 transmission (2). 8 of 20 crew members with confirmed COVID-19 had cabin mates; investigators later learned that following disembarkation, as of [4 Mar 2020], 5 of the 8 cabin mates had also developed COVID-19. This investigation underscores the need for swift epidemiologic investigation as soon as a COVID-19 case is detected in an area or group where a large number of persons gather in a closed or crowded setting (such as a cruise ship, music club, health care setting, sports arena, or gymnasium). These settings have been previously associated with infections spread by contact or droplet, such as influenza (3). Close contacts of persons with confirmed COVID-19 should self-quarantine and monitor their symptoms; persons who develop COVID-19 symptoms while on board a ship should be isolated to limit transmission to other passengers and crew. 3.

That being said, it is interesting that the highest number of crew-associated cases were among food handlers. What is not mentioned is whether the same food handlers rotated between passenger food preparation and crew food preparation. In addition, it would be interesting to see 2 epidemic curves, side by side, by date of onset of symptoms, one for the crew and one for the passengers. - Mod.MPP] A teenager's website tracking coronavirus has become one of the most vital resources for people seeking accurate and updated numbers on the pandemic. The URL is. We speak with 17-year-old Avi Schiffmann, a high school junior from Mercer Island outside Seattle, who started the site in late December 2019, when coronavirus had not yet been detected outside of China. Now the site has been visited by tens of millions, from every country on Earth. Amy Goodman [AG]...The site tracks deaths, numbers of cases locally and globally, and it talks about the number of people who have recovered. It also provides an interactive map, information on the disease, and a Twitter feed. The resource, which updates every minute or so, pulls information from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and elsewhere. Avi Schiffman [AS] Yeah, I started this website around Christmas of last year [2019 -- probably means \"during the Christmas break\", as public domain news did not start carrying information on this outbreak until 30 Dec 2019]. And I mean, the main goal of it was to provide just an easy way to see the straight facts and the data, without having to make a website that was biased or full of ads or anything like that. So you can go on a phone and just instantly see the quick facts. You can see the total amount of cases, the total deaths and, all that kind of information. And you can get that for individual countries, and now US states, too. I didn't want to make it hard. You shouldn't have to go through government websites and download daily PDFs that are probably out of date by the time you read them, and have to go through all kinds of complicated things just to see the straight facts. So, that was the main reason why I wanted to make this website. [AS]................. when I started this website, there was less than [about] 1000 total cases, and they were all in the Wuhan area of China. So, I saw this on the news kind of a long time ago, and I noticed that it was really hard just to find the information. And there was a lot of misinformation spreading. So I decided it would be kind of cool to create a website and kind of make it like a central hub of information. [AG] ...you have the number of people affected overall in the globe, and then by country, and then by region. You have the number of people who have died. And you have the number of people who have recovered. Talk about how that came into being. [AS].... that wasn't there for quite a while. And I started to get a lot of emails saying that the site was kind of overly negative. And I decided that it would be really cool if I could show how many people were recovering, to give people a more positive outlook and maybe more hope. So I added that to the quick facts. In every single country, you can see how many people have recovered, which I think gives people a lot of hope, because you can see, in places like Korea, I think, they reported more people that recovered today than people that had been infected, which is really big. And I'm also working on things like a vaccine tracker to continue making it more positive, because it shouldn't have to be super negative and you only see the amount of people that have died. [I strongly recommend folks to read the complete original interview. It is both fascinating and entertaining to read, and it is reassuring that the upcoming next generation will have creative inventive stars to brighten our days as well as our nights. An impressive kid (young man) ... - Mod.MPP]Switzerland's health care system could collapse by the end of the month [March 2020] if the new coronavirus keeps spreading at current rates, a government official warned on Tuesday [17 Mar 2020]. Swiss authorities estimated that 2650 people had tested positive for the coronavirus and said 19 people had died, while predicting cases will likely soar in the weeks ahead. Exact figures were unavailable. Daniel Koch, head of the Federal Office of Health's communicable diseases division, said the rapid rise had outstripped the state's ability to record new cases in real time. Koch urged residents to observe strict emergency measures ordered this week, including bans on events and gatherings, calling these critical in limiting the damage and protecting hospitals from a potential collapse. \"People who become infected today will only hit us in 10 days from now,\" Koch said at a news conference. \"We have to make sure the infection rate goes down today, because otherwise, in 10 days (Swiss hospitals) won't be able to handle it.\" Switzerland has mobilised up to 8000 military members to assist civil authorities and medical personnel. The country of 8.6 million can muster 1000 to 1200 intensive care beds, although Koch said there was only limited staff to operate life-saving equipment like ventilators now in desperate demand in neighbouring Italy, where more than 2100 have died. This week the World Health Organization called on all countries to ramp up testing to slow the pandemic's advance, while urging companies to boost production of vital equipment to overcome shortages. In an attempt to deal with growing numbers of suspected cases, a large blue tent was erected overnight outside the University Hospital of Geneva to screen and test the sick. A Reuters witness saw a handful of people ushered inside by an official wearing a mask and gloves on Tuesday afternoon [17 Mar 2020]. The hospital said it was planning to double its intensive care capacity by adding more beds to existing rooms. Koch defended Switzerland's evolving policy to focus testing on people most at risk and those who might need hospitalisation, rather than trying to test every person with mild symptoms. The government is urging those individuals -- mostly younger, healthy people -- to isolate themselves at home and halt contact with older or immune-compromised people. \"Initially you test as broadly as possible,\" Koch said. \"This phase is over in Europe. It is impossible at the moment ... to test everyone who might have been infected.\" [When I read articles like this I feel like we are on a runaway train trying to get to the engine to slow it down. Hopefully a collapse of the system will not occur in Switzerland. The same can be said for France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, and the UK. - Mod.MPP] Starting on Wednesday 18 Mar 2020 all Whole Foods Market stores in the US and Canada will service customers who are 60 and older one hour before opening to the public.

It is now the 8th consecutive day that the number of newly reported cases in a 24 hour period was less than 50. While there are still suspected cases reported that presumably are waiting for laboratory confirmation, fingers are crossed this adequately represents China approaching interruption of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the country. In addition, 13 deaths were reported, all of them by Hubei province. Nine new cases were reported from Hong Kong. There were 20 imported cases into China confirmed, representing 95.2% of all reported cases in the past 24 hours.

As I keep mentioning, a challenge will be to prevent importations from starting new chains of transmission within China. The 1 remaining case with local transmission, was from Wuhan in Hubei province. Interpretation: Wuhan is the location within China where the SARS-CoV-2 is still being transmitted.

The holy shrines of Imam Reza in Mashhad, Fatima Masumeh in Qom, and Shah Abdol-Azim in Tehran were shut until further notice \"upon the orders of the anti-coronavirus headquarters and the health minister,\" state television said. Qom's Jamkaran mosque also said it would close its doors, the official IRNA news agency reported. People angry over the decision protested outside Qom's Fatima Masumeh shrine, some chanting \"religious slogans\" and damaging the entrance door, IRNA reported. The coronavirus outbreak has spread to all of Iran's 31 provinces since it first emerged last month [February 2020] in Qom, which is among the worst-hit regions along with Tehran and Khorasan Razavi, where Mashhad is located. Health Minister Saeid Namaki said the shrines and \"other holy sites\" had agreed to close until after the New Year holidays, which start on Friday [20 Mar 2020]. The move came after Iran said the COVID-19 disease killed another 129 people, taking the country's overall toll to 853 dead out of 14 991 cases of infection. \"Our plea is that everyone take this virus seriously and in no way attempt to travel to any province,\" health ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour said. The disease has now killed at least 12 Iranian politicians and officials, both sitting and former, and infected 13 more who have either been quarantined or are being treated. The latest was Ayatollah Hashem Bathayi Golpayegani, a member of the Assembly of Experts -- an 88-strong body of clerics that appoints and monitors the country's supreme leader. The ayatollah, who was 78, died 2 days after testing positive for the disease and being hospitalised, state news agency IRNA reported. The novel coronavirus also claimed the life of prominent economist and political activist Fariborz Rais-Dana on Monday [16 Mar 2020]. A prolific writer with a PhD from the London School of Economics, he had spent time in prison after being convicted of spreading propaganda against the system. Iran has been scrambling to contain the rapid spread of COVID-19 since the authorities announced the 1st 2 deaths in Qom on [2 Feb 2020]. It has since shut schools, postponed cultural and sports events, and discouraged travel ahead of the New Year holidays. Iran has also cancelled the main weekly Friday prayers, closed parliament and put off the 2nd round of legislative elections. In addition, the judiciary has sent 83 000 inmates on temporary leave from jails, apparently over concerns of the virus spreading in the prison system. But Iran has yet to impose a lockdown, and the official number of deaths and infections has continued to grow exponentially. According to the health ministry, the rising trend is due to the increasing number of tests being carried out. It says many patients started showing symptoms days after they were infected. The health ministry's latest figures showed that Tehran province had the highest number of new infections with 200 cases. The central province of Isfahan followed with 118 cases, with Mazandaran in the north of Iran coming next with 96. [In the 24 hours from 15 to 16 Mar 2020, the number of cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Iran grew from 13 938 to 14 991 an increase of 1053 newly confirmed cases. The number of deaths has also increased from 724 to 853, an increase of 129 deaths in the 24 hour period. The number of cases continues to grow at an alarming rate, with reports of deaths of many notable figures in the country and of international fame.

To strengthen day-to-day operations, key agencies are embedded in the global team, including UNICEF, the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The major partner coordination mechanisms are the Emergency Medical Team (EMT) Initiative; the Global Health Cluster (GHC); and the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), which includes technical agencies, major NGOs, including Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) International, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the IFRC, and other international organizations. The core elements of health operations include clinical care and management, laboratory capacity strengthening, surveillance, case and contact tracing, infection prevention and control, risk communications and community engagement. These core elements are supported by technical networks worldwide, which draw on and support capacities in GOARN, GHC, and EMTs. In the area of risk communications and community engagement, IFRC, UNICEF and WHO have established a dedicated tripartite group to scale up and implement activities globally. In response to the call from WHO, GOARN partners have mobilized international technical assistance to support preparedness and response missions at country request and to also support capacity in WHO regions and headquarters in Geneva. In addition, Public Health England, the Indo-Pacific Health Security Centre, the Australian government, and the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention have sent staff to WHO to work on COVID-19 response in Geneva, Switzerland, Manila, Philippines, and New Delhi, India. - ensuring coordination and collaboration on technical guidance and support for preparedness and response for fragile and vulnerable populations The EMT initiative is working with the global and regional networks of emergency medical teams currently on the front lines of major national outbreaks and supporting international deployment of support where needed and requested. A major focus of the response is on case detection and contact tracing. To support country activities, partners are working closely on the deployment and implementation of Go.Data, an outbreak investigation tool for field data collection during public health emergencies. Over 50 countries have requested support, and GOARN partners are implementing a strategy for wide-scale rollout including direct country support, technical briefings, webinar/online presentations, and comprehensive remote support.

      "main_text": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced Saturday [14 Mar 2020] that Israel seeks to use technological means usually used for counter-terror to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, as the country saw diagnosed cases spike by 50 in one day. The announcement was made as part of a new set of directives issued by the government that will effectively see the country grind to a halt while it attempts to combat the coronavirus outbreak. Shortly after the announcement, Attorney General Avichai Mendelblit approved the use of cyber measures to track patients' phones. The Justice Ministry, responding to a Haaretz query, said the directive was legal under the regulations that were put in place to fight the virus. A representative told Haaretz that the ministry's legal opinion would be \"forwarded to the Shin Bet security service and brought before the government on Sunday [15 Mar 2020].\" The prime minister called COVID-19 an \"invisible enemy,\" and said \"all means would be used to fight the spread of the coronavirus, including technological means, digital means, and other means that until today I have refrained from using among the civilian population.\" According to sources familiar with the policy, Netanyahu is primarily referring to the use of cellular geolocalization to verify the past whereabouts of patients that have tested positive for COVID-19, or to check whether they had violated a quarantine order. Some other forms of digital surveillance may also be used. \"...According to a senior law enforcement official, police have recently used cellular phones to verify their versions of coronavirus patients for being in certain places. For example, the police assisted the Ministry of Health as part of an examination conducted by a resident of Or Yehuda, who was infected with the coronavirus, when he used cellphone tracking to trace his tracks. However, police have made it clear this evening that they do not intend to use cellular tracking for activities against coronavirus patients. \"We do not intend to detect people and do not intend to detain them,\" an organization official stressed. \"Netanyahu announced tonight that in order to curb the spread of the virus, \"all means will be used ... including technological means to combat terrorism, which I have so far avoided activating in the civilian public. But there is no choice.\" Netanyahu also said: \"I asked the Justice Department for these steps. They are not simple; they have a certain amount of harm to the privacy of those people, who will check who came in contact with the sick and what preceded it. It is an effective tool for detecting the virus.\" Informed sources said that Netanyahu's 1st and foremost intention was to follow the cell phones of those diagnosed with the disease. This is to ascertain, among other things, whether they were in isolation. The officials added that other digital surveillance measures may also be used to ascertain where the patients are. The ISA was asked to contribute its capabilities to the move. The Korean government was publishing personal details of each confirmed case that permitted app developers to design apps to warn the population if they were going near SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, basically using a similar design as proposed above but for public use. - Mod.MPP The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority announced a USD 13.3 billion program to cushion the private sector from the impact of the epidemic. Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi decided to suspend school and university classes for 2 weeks starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020] over concerns about the spread of the coronavirus. Sisi also allocated 100 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 6.36 billion) to finance the anti-COVID-19 fight. Speaking at a special cabinet meeting, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Ishtaye said Palestine was the 1st to follow China's example by taking timely measures to fight the deadly disease and has been successful in controlling it thus far. Ibrahim Melhem, spokesman of the Palestinian Authority, said Palestine follows in China's steps to stop the spread of COVID-19, which has largely been controlled by China about 2 months after its outbreak. \"The full cooperation between the Chinese government and its people and securing food that was sufficient for 2 weeks have all contributed to limiting the spread of the virus,\" Melhem said. Lebanon informed Syria that it will close its land borders with Syria starting Monday [16 Mar 2020] as a measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19. To contain the spread of the virus, Morocco took new measures, including a ban on mass gatherings of more than 50 people. A ban on flights was extended to Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal, in addition to Italy, France, Spain and Algeria. Oman on Saturday [14 Mar 2020] announced a one-month suspension of all schools and universities starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020] amid concerns over the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. Jordan also decided to suspend all schools, universities and educational institutions for 2 weeks starting Sunday [15 Mar 2020]. All flights from and to Jordan will be suspended from [17 Mar 2020] until further notice. All sea and land borders are closed except for commercial movement and shipping, while gatherings and large events, including prayers at mosques and churches, are also banned. In Syria, one of the only 2 countries in the Middle East that are reportedly unaffected by COVID-19, President Bashar al-Assad ordered the postponement of the parliamentary elections from [13 Apr 2020] to [20 May 2020] to prevent the spread of the virus. In Yemen, another country reportedly free of any COVID-19 case, the internationally-recognized government decided to suspend all flights to and from Yemeni airports for 2 weeks, starting Wednesday [18 Mar 2020]. Flights for humanitarian purposes and relief aid will be excluded from the ban. The Yemeni government also ordered the temporary closure of the country's border crossings, with exception for commercial, relief, and humanitarian shipping traffic. Meanwhile, the Houthi militia that controls northern Yemen announced the suspension of international flights for 2 weeks, while deciding to end the school year this month [March 2020], ahead of schedule, in the cities under its control.
